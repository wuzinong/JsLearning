-----Azure Database Migration Service
Migrate from on-premises or cloud implementations of MongoDB to Azure Cosmos DB with minimal
downtime by using Azure Database Migration Service. Perform resilient migrations of MongoDB data at scale
and with high reliability.
//Scenario: Data migration from on-premises to Azure must minimize costs and downtime


-----on-premises data gateway
Before you can connect to on-premises data sources from Azure Logic Apps, download and install the
on-premises data gateway on a local computer. The gateway works as a bridge that provides quick data
transfer and encryption between data sources on premises (not in the cloud) and your logic apps.

-----ISEs
You can access to Azure Virtual Network resources from Azure Logic Apps by using integration service
environments (ISEs).
Sometimes, your logic apps and integration accounts need access to secured resources, such as virtual
machines (VMs) and other systems or services, that are inside an Azure virtual network. To set up this access,
you can create an integration service environment (ISE) where you can run your logic apps and create your
integration accounts.


-----Dynamic site acceleration
Dynamic site acceleration (DSA) is available for Azure CDN Standard from Akamai, Azure CDN Standard
from Verizon, and Azure CDN Premium from Verizon profiles
DSA includes various techniques that benefit the latency and performance of dynamic content. Techniques
include route and network optimization, TCP optimization, and more.
